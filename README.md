# Capstone---Predicting-Barriers-to-Employment-Resulting-from-Incarceration

*This was a group Capstone project.*

Formerly incarcerated individuals face various societal, ed- ucational, housing, and employment challenges after being released from prison and re-entering society. Since employment impacts recidivism among formerly incarcerated individuals, this work aims to develop a system that will provide or- ganizations with this data and a tool for formerly incarcer- ated individuals to understand what consequences are attached to a job description. In this paper, we used data from the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction (NICCC). Moreover, we develop an interactive dashboard to empower job-seekers with knowledge on barrier crimes per industry and jurisdiction. Additionally, a model was developed to assist formerly incarcerated individuals and organizations with finding employment. We build a model that predicts the collateral consequences and NICCC industry keywords applied to a specific job posting using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Logistic Regression model using a Bi-gram TFIDF matrix yield a 61% accuracy score. Addi- tionally, we consider historically posted job listings on major job boards such as monster.com, indeed.com, dice.com, and careerbuilder.com with higher accuracy scores of 74% and 84% via Random Forest and XG Boost respectively using word-level matrices. Code is available on our GitHub page here.
